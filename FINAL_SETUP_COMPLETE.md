# ✅ FINAL SETUP COMPLETE - AWS Lambda Backend

## 🎉 Summary

Your `index.html` is now configured to call your **AWS Lambda functions** via API Gateway!

---

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### Frontend (index.html)
```javascript
AWS_API_GATEWAY: 'https://0qi3oyu8a2.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default'

Endpoints:
  - /electionMetricsApi (POST)
  - /topJurisdictionsApi (POST)
  - /jurisdictionMapApi (POST)
  - /turnoutSeriesApi (GET)
  - /queryApi (POST)
  - /testClickhouseApi (GET)
  - /helloApi (GET)
```

### Environment Detection
```javascript
✅ Local (localhost:5005): Uses local Node.js server
✅ Amplify: Uses AWS API Gateway Lambda functions
```

---

## 🚀 What Happens Now

### On Localhost:
```
Visit: http://localhost:5005
APIs call: http://localhost:5005/api/election-metrics
Backend: Your local server.js
```

### On Amplify:
```
Visit: https://main.d2jwaen2uj4ggz.amplifyapp.com
APIs call: https://0qi3oyu8a2.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/electionMetricsApi
Backend: AWS Lambda functions
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Fix API Gateway Authorization

Your APIs are using **AWS_IAM** authorization which blocks public access!

### Quick Fix (5 minutes):

**See:** `FIX_API_GATEWAY_AUTH.md` for detailed steps

**Summary:**
1. Open API Gateway Console
2. For each API, change Authorization: `AWS_IAM` → `NONE`
3. Deploy API
4. Test with curl

---

## 🧪 Test Your Lambda Functions Right Now

```bash
# Test hello
curl https://0qi3oyu8a2.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/helloApi

# Test election metrics
curl -X POST https://0qi3oyu8a2.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/electionMetricsApi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"election\":\"Nov 2024\"}"
```

**If you get:** `{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}`
→ Follow `FIX_API_GATEWAY_AUTH.md` to fix authorization

**If you get:** Data
→ Perfect! Commit and push
