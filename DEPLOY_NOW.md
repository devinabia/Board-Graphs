## üß™ Verification Commands

Run these to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test backend directly
curl https://amac-dashboard-api.onrender.com/api/hello

# Test through Amplify (after rewrite rule)
curl https://main.d2jwaen2uj4ggz.amplifyapp.com/api/hello

# Test election metrics
curl -X POST https://main.d2jwaen2uj4ggz.amplifyapp.com/api/election-metrics \

  -d "{\"election\":\"Nov 2024\"}"
```

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Issue: Render says "Build failed"

**Fix:** Check build logs. Most common issues:
- Missing `package.json` (you have it ‚úÖ)
- Wrong build command (use `npm install`)

### Issue: Backend starts but crashes

**Fix:** Missing environment variables
- Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Environment
- Verify all 5 variables are set
- Click "Manual Deploy" to restart

### Issue: Amplify still shows 404

**Fix:** Rewrite rule not applied yet
- Go to Amplify Console
- Check "Rewrites and redirects" page
- Rule should show with green checkmark
- If not, re-add it

### Issue: CORS errors in browser

**Fix:** Your code already has CORS! ‚úÖ
- Check that Render service is running
- Verify rewrite rule type is "Rewrite (200)" not "Redirect"

## üí∞ Cost

**Render.com Free Tier:**
- ‚úÖ Free forever
- ‚úÖ 750 hours/month (enough for 24/7)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sleeps after 15 min of inactivity (wakes on first request)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds

**To keep it awake (optional):**
Use a ping service like UptimeRobot (free) to ping every 5 minutes.

## üéØ What Happens Now

1. **Frontend (Amplify):**
   - Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Fast CDN delivery
   - `https://main.d2jwaen2uj4ggz.amplifyapp.com`

2. **Backend (Render):**
   - Runs your `server.js` + API handlers
   - Connects to ClickHouse
   - `https://amac-dashboard-api.onrender.com`

3. **Connection:**
   - Amplify rewrite rule proxies `/api/*` to Render
   - Frontend calls `/api/election-metrics`
   - Amplify forwards to Render backend
   - Backend returns data
   - Frontend displays it ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ú® Summary

‚úÖ **Deploy to Render:** 5 minutes
‚úÖ **Configure Amplify rewrite:** 2 minutes
‚úÖ **Test and verify:** 1 minute
üéâ **Total time:** 8 minutes

Your backend will be live with the same data you see locally! üöÄ
